        I am currently studying to become a full stack developer. I love solving algorithms and puzzles along with being creative, so developing web applications is an indulgence! When I am not creating content, I train and compete as a triathlete at the national and world level. To unwind and recharge, I love to spend time outdoors, camping, hiking, and going on soul-filling adventures which inspire me to dive even deeper into my creativity. That's a great programming loop to be in! It puts the cherry on top of the ice-cream.
